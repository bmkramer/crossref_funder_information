# Crossref funder information per publisher

This repo contains data and code for querying the Crossref API for proportion of current journal articles (current year and 2 previous years) with funding information, per Crossref member ID. Data are also collected for book chapters and preprints.

At the time of sampling (March 15, 2022), **25.2% of journal articles published in 2020-2022** had funding information available in Crossref. The following figure shows the proportion of journal articles from selected major publishers published between 2020 and 2022 that had funding information available.

Differences between publishers could reflect:  
-  disciplinary differences in the proportion of research output resulting from (external) funding  
-  differences in proportion of research articles vs. 'paratext' (editorials, letters, etc) in journals  
-  differences in publisher/journal practices requesting funder information from authors  
-  differences in publisher systems/workflows in submitting funder information as part of Crossref metadata
